MODEL DESCRIPTION
=================

1) 3D RTM of lower basal temperature with a resolution of 4,158 grid cells, dimension 2.7 x 1.25 x 5 km
2) Permeability of basement = 1 mD 
3) Ocean layer on top, temperature 25C 
4) Using TOUGHREACT v3.85
5) RSA = 1000, initial dolomite fraction 1% (kinetic) and calcite 99% (thermodynamic)
6) Initial geothermal gradient = 35 C/km
7) Calculate porosity and permeability changes from reaction (KCPL = 1); Cubic law and Kozeny-Carman are applied to FDZ and matrix, respectively 
8) TOLCH and MAXITPAD = 1E-10 and 1E-12, respectively
9) Add Br- as tracer into the system
10) SI = 0 at all cells of basement (i.e. cells at depth 4-5 km)
11) Simulation time 15 kyr, report result every 1,000 years
