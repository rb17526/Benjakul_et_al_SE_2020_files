<b>Input Files for Reactive Transport Models in Benjakul et al. (2020)</b>

This repository includes the input files of the numerical models in the paper entitled "<b><i>Understanding controls on hydrothermal dolomitisation: insights from 3D Reactive Transport Modelling of geothermal convection</i></b>".

https://doi.org/10.5194/se-2020-99

We used TOUGHREACT, a numerical simulation program developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) which is available at: https://tough.lbl.gov/licensing-download/toughreact-licensing-download/ to numerically model the convection of seawater in a single fault within carbonate-hosted system. The parameters used in the numerical models are given in the paper.
