<h1>Output Files from Reactive Transport Models in Benjakul et al. (2020)</h2>

This repository includes the output files of the numerical models in the paper entitled "<b><i>Understanding controls on hydrothermal dolomitisation: insights from 3D Reactive Transport Modelling of geothermal convection</i></b>".

https://doi.org/10.5194/se-2020-99

We used <b>TOUGHREACT</b>, a numerical simulation program developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) which is available at: https://tough.lbl.gov/licensing-download/toughreact-licensing-download/ to numerically model the convection of seawater in a single fault within carbonate-hosted system. The parameters used in the numerical models are given in the paper.

The output files from TOUGHREACT are visualized using <b>trexplot</b>, a python script developed under Hamish Robertsonâ€™s initiative which can be found at: https://github.com/hammytheham/trexplot (last access: 5 December 2020).
